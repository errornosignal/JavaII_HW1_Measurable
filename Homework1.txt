Java II Fall 2017

Homework 1
1. Create an interface called Measurable. It should contain one method defined as:
    o double getMeasure();
2. Write a static generic method PairUtil.minmax that computes the minimum and maximum
    elements of List of type T and returns a pair containing the minimum and maximum value.
    Require that the List elements implement the Measurable interface. NOTE: You will need to
    create a class that implements Measurable â€“ Any class will do, for example, consider a class Star
    of which we might measure its luminosity in watts.
3. Repeat the method above, but require that the list elements extend the generic Comparable
    type.
4. Make the Measurable interface from into a generic class - GenericMeasurable. Provide a static
    method that returns the largest element of a List, provided that the elements are instances of
    Measurable. Be sure to return a value of type T. Make sure that the elements of the List can
    implement Measurable for appropriate types U.

What you submit
    You will need to include screenshots of you application running. No external documentation is required,
    but you will need to have complete and appropriate Javadoc in the code.

Submitting your Program
    You will submit this assignment on blackboard. You are allowed one submission. You will need to submit
    your .java files and your screenshot.
